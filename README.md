Picnic Quest - Automated Picnic & Date Planner
The Challenge: Planning a date or an outing with friends can be a hassle, with countless options for locations, activities, and budget constraints.

My Solution: I designed and developed a React-based platform that automates this process. By integrating various APIs, Picnic Quest auto-generates personalized outing plans, complete with event suggestions, hotel recommendations, and a tailored budget breakdown. This project showcases my skills in full-stack development, API integration, and creating a user-friendly interface.
